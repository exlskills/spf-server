  info_md: "### About Java\n\nJava is a programming language, developed by Sun Microsystems
    and first released in 1995 (release 1.0). Since that time, it gained large popularity
    mainly due to two characteristics:\n-    A Java programme is hardware and operating
    system independent. If well written (!), the same Java programme, compiled once,
    will run identically on a SUN/Solaris workstation, a PC/Windows computer or a
    Macintosh computer. This universal executability is made possible because a Java
    programme is run through a Java Virtual Machine.\n\n-    It is an object-oriented
    language. This feature is mainly of interest for software developers\n\n### Why
    Learn Java with EXLskills?\n\nAt EXLskills we provide all possible resources to
